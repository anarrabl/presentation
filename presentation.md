Motivation
============

Introduction
-------------

- Inability of the AK model to produce a convingin model of long term growth and convergence.
- Endogenous growht theory: Innovation-based models.

Similarities
---------------

- No demand for leisure so they offer L inelastically.
- Utilitiy function: 

$$u(c)= c^{1-\epsilon}/(1-\epsilon)$$

- Total amount of final good used in producing intermediate products: 

$$X_{t} = \int_{0}^{M_{t}} X_{i} di$$ 

(x=xi  for all i).

- Free market entry.

Differences
----------------
- Alternative assumption of the Romer Model with Labour as R&D Input: 
  - L can be used in manufacturing the final good ($L_{1}$);
  - L can be used in research ($L_{2}$). 
  
$L= L_{1}+ L_{2}$


Results
==============

Product-Variety model (I)
------------------

- Each intermediate good producer is a monopolist for the product.
- Mazimizing the flow of profit at each date.
- Equilibrium profit:
  - $$\pi= ((1-\alpha)/\alpha) L\alpha^{2/(1-\alpha)}$$

Product-Variety model (II)
-----------------

- Because $x=xi$ for all i then, $x=X_{t}/M_{t}$ and  using $M_{t}x$ the final good output and GDP will both be proportional to the degree of product variety:

$$Y_{t} = M_{t}(L^{1-\alpha}x^{\alpha}-x)$$
- Growth rate:

$$g=(1/\epsilon) (\lambda (1-\alpha/\alpha L\alpha^{2/1-\alpha}-\rho)$$


Romer model(I)
-----------------
- Each intermediate good producer is a monopolist for the product.
- Mazimizing the flow of profit at each date.
- Equilibrium profit:
  - $\pi =((1-\alpha)/\alpha) L_{1}\alpha^{2/(1-\alpha)}$
  - If profits increase, the prospect of these rents will motivate research activities aimed at discovering new varieties.

Romer Model (II)
--------------------
$$\phi<1$$

- the final good output and GDP will both also be proportional to the degree of product variety:


$g = M = \lambda L_{2}$ so we have $r=(L-g)$
$$g = (\lambda\alpha L-\rho)/(\alpha+\epsilon)$$

Conclusion
=============
Final results(I)
----------------
- We obtain similar conclusions for both models.
- Growth increases with:
  -  Productivity of research activities and the size of the economy. 
  -  The equilibrium growth rate is always less than the social optimum.

Final results (II)
--------------------
   
- Intermediate firmsdo not internalize their contribution to the division of labour;
- Researchers do not internalize research spill overs;
- Ideas are non-rival and exclusive "goods".
